         <p class="purple">Download via HTTPS.
         </p>
         <p class="purple">SecBSD can be obtained via HTTPS.
            Typically you only need a single small piece of boot media and then the rest
            of the files can be installed from a number of locations, including directly
            off the internet.
            Consult the <a href="docs.html#overview">installation guide</a> for details.
         </p>
         <p class="purple">Choose a mirror near you from the following list of mirrors
            which provide SecBSD.
         </p>

         <p>Information for prospective mirrors</p>
         <p class="purple">To be listed on this page we require mirrors
            to be fast, up to date, capable, and well-connected to networks
            in the region in which they serve.
         </p>
         <p>Mirrors must carry the following:</p>
         <p>OS and packages for all architectures supported
            by SecBSD.
         </p>
         <p class="purple">As of Jan 2024, the minimum space required is approximately
            250GB.
         </p>
         <p>However, to reduce problems for users when snapshot
            packages are updated,
            it is strongly recommended to use the rsync options
            --delete-delay --delay-updates which requires additional space
            during updates.
            --fuzzy may also be helpful to reduce the amount of data transferred
            when updating snapshot packages. Depending on the disk space
            available, mirrors may provide more contents, such as older releases,
            current source tree, etc.
         </p>
         <p>Operators of mirrors who are interested in having their site added
            to the list on this page should contact purplerain@secbsd.org with
            further details about their site, including network connectivity,
            geographic location, and general information.
